## Changes in 1.3.2

- Rework temporary directory handling.
  Temporary scripts will now be created in the user home directory ~/.xpipe/temp instead of the global temp directory
  to fix cases in which permission issues occurred on Linux when trying to clear the directory caused by multiple
  users sharing the same directory.
- Fix LXD socket access permission issues by checking the actual socket permissions rather than just user groups.
- Fix startup errors due to unrecognized shell type on macOS when Fig was installed
- Fix connection creator dialog not showing an error if it occurred before
  and also throwing errors when a screen reader was active.
- Fix filter text field becoming stuck in a loop and freezing up
- Many other small miscellaneous fixes and improvements
