## Connection notes

There is now the new option to add notes to any connection. These notes are written in markdown, and the full markdown spec is supported. 

## Git vault improvements

The conflict resolution has been improved
- When setting up the git vault on another system, there will no longer be an initial merge conflict that has to be handled
- In case of a merge conflict, overwriting local changes will now preserve all connections that are not added to the git vault, including local connections
- You now have the option to force push changes when a conflict occurs while XPipe is running, not requiring a restart anymore

## Other

- You can now add simple RDP connections without a file
- Make file transfers more resilient. This should fix rare issues in which the remote file content was not properly written
- Fix VMware Player/Workstation not being detected on Windows. Now simply searching for connections should add these VMs automatically.
