## Windows updater issues

The last few versions of XPipe from 1.7.16 to 8.0.1 all had a self-updater on Windows that was not working properly. This was caused by a newly introduced JDK bug. This is now fixed from 8.0.2 onwards.

To upgrade to 8.0.2+, you have to do it manually by downloading and installing it from https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases. There shouldn't be any more problems with 8.0.2+ after that.

## Git Vault Versioning

When upgrading XPipe versions across many systems, one problem could have been the git vault format being updated on one system and being pulled on another a system that is running an older version. From now on, there will be a warning shown when the versions do not match up. From there you can choose to temporarily disable the git vault during a session until you upgrade to the matching version on that system as well.

## Searching for hosts

You can now search for IPs and hostnames in addition to the connection names to filter your connection list.
