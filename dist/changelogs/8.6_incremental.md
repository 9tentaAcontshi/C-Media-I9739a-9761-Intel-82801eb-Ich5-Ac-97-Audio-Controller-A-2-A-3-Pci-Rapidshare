## Education professional licenses

There is now the possibility to use XPipe professional for free for students and faculty from accredited educational institutions (high schools, colleges, and universities). Just send an email to hello@xpipe.io with your official email address of your educational institution.

## Other changes

- Fix passwords not being properly supplied to some CLI programs like ssh or git on older Linux systems if xpipe was started from a terminal. The programs prompted the parent terminal session instead of the xpipe askpass. This is now fixed by calling setsid.
- Fix elevation prompt requiring unnecessary confirmation the first time when the setting to always require elevation confirmation was active
