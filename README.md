### A flexible connection manager and remote file explorer

X-Pipe is a brand-new type of connection manager and remote file explorer that works by only interacting with established command-line
tools on local and remote shell connections.
This approach makes it much more flexible as it doesn't have to deal with file system APIs or remote file handling
protocols at all.

It currently supports:
- Containers located on any host, e.g. [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) container instances
- [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) connections
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) instances located on any host
- [Powershell Remote Sessions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.3)
- Any other custom remote connection methods that works through the command-line
- Arbitrary types of proxies to establish connections

Furthermore, X-Pipe integrates with your existing tools and workflows
by outsourcing as many tasks as possible to your favourite
text/code editors, terminals, shells, command-line tools and more.
The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing anyone
to implement custom functionality through extensions.
