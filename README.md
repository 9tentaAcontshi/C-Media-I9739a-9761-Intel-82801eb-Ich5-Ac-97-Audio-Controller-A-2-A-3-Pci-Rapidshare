### The remote file browser for professionals

XPipe is a brand-new type of remote file browser that works by only interacting with your installed command-line tools on local and remote shell connections. This approach makes it much more flexible as it doesn't have to deal with file system APIs or remote file handling protocols at all.

It currently supports:
- Containers located on any host such as [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) container instances
- [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) connections
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) instances
- [Powershell Remote Sessions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.3)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters and their contained pods and containers
- Any other custom remote connection methods that works through the command-line
- Arbitrary types of proxies to establish connections

Furthermore, XPipe integrates with your existing tools and workflows by delegating all tasks to your favourite text/code editors, terminals, shells, command-line tools and more. The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing anyone to implement custom functionality through extensions.
