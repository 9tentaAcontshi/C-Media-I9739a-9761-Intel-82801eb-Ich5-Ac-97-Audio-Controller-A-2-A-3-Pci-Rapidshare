### Information about Malwarebytes

XPipe detected that you are running Malwarebytes. Certain protection settings in Malwarebytes Pro can slow down XPipe massively to the point where it's basically unusable.
The free Malwarebytes version is not affected by this interaction, so it shouldn't be a problem.
If you are running the paid Malwarebytes Pro version, you will have access to the `Exploit Protection` under the `Real-time Protection` mode. When this setting is active, any shell access is slowed down, resulting in XPipe becoming very slow.

### What you can do

In case you are facing performance problems with XPipe and Malwarebytes, it is recommended to try to disable the `Exploit Protection` setting for XPipe and see whether it makes a difference.
